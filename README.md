# Social Network API

## Description 

The purpose of this project was to get experience using NoSQL and getting more practice with routes and models. This project is currently not functional and will have future updates in order to demonstrate its functionality. As of right now it has a good framework to build off of for future developement. The main goal of the project in its current state is to show off my experience with coding the necessary routes, controllers, models, and configuration files. 

## Installation

Make sure to have all the necessary packages installed when running this build from the command line!

## Credits

Thank you to the University of Arizona for educating me these past 6 months. It has been a long, challenging, and time consuming process but I now possess the knowledge and basic foundation to continue learning how to code and develope applications and apply it to a future job. Thank you so much to all the staff that have helped me along the way. I cannot wait to eventually fully move into the world of software developement!
